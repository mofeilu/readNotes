(1) point in polygon:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon#Ray_casting_algorithm
solution: we can count crossing number of vertical ray starting from (x0,y0), if it intersect with polygon even times, it is outside,
otherwise it is inside.  we test if the ray intersect with each of the polgyon's edges to count the total number of intersection

(2) Given three point a, b, and c, is a-b-c a counterclockwise turn ?
solution: we can calculate the area of triangle formed by a-b-c by using determinants:  
A = cross_product(ab, ac) = (bx - ax)(cy - ay) - (by - ay）（cx - ax);
if A > 0:  a-b-c is CCW
if A < 0:  a-b-c is CW
if A = 0:  a-b-c is colinear

(3) given two line segments, do they intersect ?
soluton: assme we have (l1.p1, l1.p2),  (l2.p1, l2.p2).  l1 intersect l2 if and only if
CCW of (l1.p1, l1.p2, l2.p1) different from CCW of (l1.p1, l1.p2, l2.p2)
and CCW of (l2.p1, l2.p2, l1.p1) different from CCW of (l2.p1, l2.p2, l1.p2)

formally,  we need:  ccw(l1.p1, l1.p2, l2.p1) * ccw(l1.p1, l1.p2, l2.p2) <= 0  && ccw(l2.p1, l2.p2, l1.p1) * ccw (l2.p1, l2.p2, l1.p2) <= 0 


(4) find convex hull of set of points
   https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/geometric-algorithms/#polygon
   wrapping, graham, etc
   also need to know insert/delete point and reconstruct convex hull

(5) closest pair (Eucldian dist) in N points


(6) voronoi diagrams

(7) KD tree, red black Tree

(8）how many hexagons and petagons a football have
(assume that we know each hexagon have 3 petagon neighbor and each petagon have 5 hexagon neighbor)
solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/number-pentagons-hexagons-football/
we need to use Euler's theorm:　V-E+F = 2 (V is # of vertices, E is # of edges and F is # of faces)

assume we have H hexagons and P petagons,
we have:  E = (6H - 5P)/2;  V = (6H + 5P)/3;  F = H + P;
also due to the neighbor arrangements, we should have: H * 3/5 = P
solve with euler's theorm, we got H = 20, P = 12


(9) minimum area of regular polygon (equal edge length) with 3 points given
solution:
the result regular polygon must sit on a circle, which can be determined by given 3 points.
we then need to determine the minimum number of edges n of regular polgygon (this imply a min area 
regular polygon).  

let's say the arc controled by each side of the given trianlge is A, B, C.
then minimum n = 2*pi/GCD(A,B,C). 
(draw a picture and then you will understand the intutition)
