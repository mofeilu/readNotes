agagin,  need to review Trie (this is related to system design of google typeahead)

-----------------------------------------

review BST balanced BST, Trie, graph related alg
review motion planning : Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm 
------------------------------------------------
for DRC we can use segment tree, the tutorial of segment tree is here:

Need to review all geometry related algs
see book: Computational Geometry In C 2nd ed. - J. O'Rourke (1997)
paper: Dynamic algorithms in computational geometry

for alg and DS, need to re-read the book "introduction to algorithm"

keywords:
convex hull, polygon,  voronoi diagrams, search and intersection...
