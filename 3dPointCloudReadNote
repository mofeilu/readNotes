The book:  Reconstruction and Analysis of 3D Scenes_ From Irregularly Distributed 3D Points to Object Classes

just focus on chapter 4

-------------topic to study: 3d point cloud registration ---------------
method that need good intial alignment:
iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm,  Least Squares 3D surface matching (LS3D)

keypint extraction and matching:  Harris corner detector,  scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), determinant of hessian (DoH), 
Seepd-Up Robust Features(SURF).
